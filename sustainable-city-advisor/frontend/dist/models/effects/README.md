# Effects Models

This directory contains 3D models and effect assets used in the Sustainable City Advisor game.

The following models/effects should be placed here:
- smoke_effect.glb
- heavy_smoke.glb
- sparkle.glb
- energy_glow.glb
- clean_air.glb
- knowledge.glb
- health.glb

You can use assets from free 3D model repositories such as:
- Sketchfab (free assets)
- Google Poly Archive
- TurboSquid (free assets)
- Clara.io

Alternatively, these effects can be created procedurally in Three.js using particle systems and shaders.
