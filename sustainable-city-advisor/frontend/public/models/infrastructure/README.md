# Infrastructure Models

This directory contains 3D models for various infrastructure elements used in the Sustainable City Advisor game.

The following models should be placed here:
- transport_hub.glb
- bus_stop.glb
- train_station.glb
- improved_road.glb
- recycling_center.glb
- recycle_bin.glb
- solar_farm.glb
- wind_turbine.glb
- solar_panels.glb
- parking_lot.glb
- sports_field.glb
- fountain.glb

You can use assets from free 3D model repositories such as:
- Sketchfab (free assets)
- Google Poly Archive
- TurboSquid (free assets)
- Clara.io

Ensure all models are optimized for web use (low poly count) and exported in GLB format.
