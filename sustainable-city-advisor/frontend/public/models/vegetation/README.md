# Vegetation Models

This directory contains 3D models for various vegetation elements used in the Sustainable City Advisor game.

The following models should be placed here:
- community_park.glb
- botanical_garden.glb
- playground.glb
- dog_park.glb
- tree.glb
- small_park.glb

You can use assets from free 3D model repositories such as:
- Sketchfab (free assets)
- Google Poly Archive
- TurboSquid (free assets)
- Clara.io

Ensure all models are optimized for web use (low poly count) and exported in GLB format.
