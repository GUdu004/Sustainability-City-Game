# Sustainable City Advisor - Development Plan

## The Game Mechanics

The Sustainable City Advisor game centers around the player taking on the role of a city mayor. The core mechanics revolve around managing the city's growth while balancing environmental, economic, and happiness factors.

*   **Turn-Based Decision Loop:** The game progresses in turns (representing days or weeks). Each turn, the player is presented with a single decision or scenario related to city management and sustainability.
*   **Three Key Stats:** The game tracks three vital city statistics:
    *   **Environment ðŸŒ±:** Represents the health of the natural environment within and around the city.
    *   **Economy ðŸ’°:** Represents the city's financial status and economic growth.
    *   **Happiness ðŸ˜Š:** Represents the satisfaction and well-being of the city's citizens.
    These stats are displayed prominently to the player and are impacted by their decisions.
*   **AI Advisor:** Before making a decision, the player receives advice from an AI advisor. This advisor can be rule-based or powered by the Gemini API, offering insights, warnings, or humorous commentary related to the decision's potential consequences.
*   **Decision Impact:** Each decision the player makes has a quantifiable impact on the three key stats. Some decisions may boost one stat while negatively affecting another, creating trade-offs.
*   **3D City View:** A dynamic 3D model of the city is displayed, visually updating based on the player's decisions. New buildings might appear, areas might become greener or more polluted, reflecting the consequences of their choices.
*   **End States:** The game features multiple possible endings based on the player's performance and the final state of the three key stats. These endings can range from a thriving "Green Utopia" to a collapsing "Corporate Dystopia."

## Technical Stack

*   **Backend:** Node.js (Express or similar), TypeScript
*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
*   **3D Visualization:** Three.js
*   **Database:** Firestore (GCP)
*   **AI Integration:** Gemini API
*   **Deployment & Hosting:** Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run, Firebase Hosting), Firebase Studio
*   **Version Control:** Git

    *   [x] Source or create low-poly 3D models for buildings, terrain, trees, and other city elements. Use Three.js loaders (e.g., `GLTFLoader`, `OBJLoader`) to import these models. (Added GLTFLoader and placeholder loading logic)
    *   [x] Set up realistic lighting (directional light for sun, ambient light) and shadows in the Three.js scene. (Implemented shadow maps and light/object shadow properties)
    *   [x] Implement user-friendly camera controls (orbiting, panning, zooming) to allow players to view their city from different angles. (OrbitControls implemented in `CityView.tsx`)
8.  Visual Feedback Implementation with Three.js:
    *   [x] Changing the appearance of existing 3D objects: Modify material colors or textures to indicate pollution levels (e.g., brownish haze, greyed-out buildings) or environmental health (e.g., vibrant greenery, clean water). (Implemented ground color change based on environment stat)
    *   [x] Dynamically adding or removing 3D models: When a player builds a new structure (factory, park, solar farm), add the corresponding 3D model to the scene. When a structure is removed or replaced, remove the model. The backend will send data indicating which visual changes are needed. (Implemented adding/removing models based on sceneElements state)
    *   [x] Potentially adding visual effects: Implement subtle visual cues like smoke particles from factories or glowing solar panels.

### Phase 4: Enhancements and Polish (Weeks 10-12)

    *   [ ] Process the Gemini API response to extract the generated advice text. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls.
10. Dynamic AI Personality Refinement:
    *   [ ] Implement logic in the Node.js backend to give the AI advisor a more dynamic personality (funny, sarcastic, serious) by varying the prompt sent to the Gemini API or by using predefined personality profiles to filter/modify Gemini's output.
11. Multiple Endings Development:
    *   [ ] Develop distinct end-game narratives, visual elements, and potentially short animations or summaries in the backend based on the final game state.
    *   [ ] Create compelling and visually appealing end-game screens in the frontend using React.
12. Unlockables and Titles Implementation:
    *   [ ] Implement backend logic to track player achievements and key decisions throughout the game.

    *   [ ] UI sounds (button clicks, notifications).
    *   [ ] Event sounds (decision made, stat change notification, end-game).
    *   [ ] Environmental sounds (subtle city ambiance, nature sounds if environment is high, industrial sounds if economy is high).
    *   [ ] Advisor voice or sound cues (optional).
17. Music Plan: Plan the game's music, considering:
    *   [ ] Background music that sets the tone.
    *   [ ] Dynamic music that changes based on the city's state or the player's performance (e.g., more upbeat when stats are good, more somber when they are low).
    *   [ ] Music for end screens.
18. Sound and Music Implementation:
    *   [ ] Source or create sound effects and music tracks.
    *   [ ] Implement audio playback in the frontend using the Web Audio API or a library.
    *   [ ] Integrate sounds and music with game events and state changes.

### Deployment with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase Studio
